+THE GAME+
==========
Pieces of incoming food need to be send to the corresponding animal. But which
piece of food goes where? That's up for you to find out! One hint:

EVERYBODY LIKES *BACON*!

+++++++++++++
+HOW TO PLAY+
=============
Arrow keys for setting the direction the food has to be sent, enter to start
and restart the game. To start the game, just doubleclick radishsort.jar. Oh,
you need Java to play the game, by the way. You probably have it installed
already.

+ABOUT THE GAME+
================
The game "Radish Sort" (radish, radix... Get it?) is a game made for the
Bacongamejam #7, the gamejam on reddit. It was made in 48 hours with Java,
LibGDX and the sites www.incompetech.com, www.opengameart.com,
www.openclipart.com, and www.freesoundproject.org. It was a lot of fun and I
learned a lot, especially since I was using LibGDX for the second time for a
gamejam. Comparing to the first time I used it (The Arbitrary Gamejam of
february if I recall correctly), I think I did a lot better this time.
